            <h1> PROJECT: TOMODACHI </h1>
            <li>
              <h3> Overview </h3>
              <p> <b> TOMODACHI </b> is a 24/7 not-for-profit cross-platform online mental support. It is intended to function based on volunteers and/or donations alone. It provides two chat categories such as anon-to-anon and anon-to-professional mental support for ages 17+ and above. It offers end-to-end encryption (E2EE) and matches users with their respective age bracket allowing users to share their inner most thoughts to a peer or a professional no matter how bad or good it gets. By professional, it will consist of volunteer licenced psychologists and therapists. A great deal of privacy concern is involved; however, turning on location services is required as protocol for emergency purposes only.

              <h3> Motivation </h3>
              <p> I for one has been struggling with different mental disorders ever since I could remember. I can’t afford professional help as it is something you will have to do often and the most I could probably afford would likely be 3-5 sessions when most people can’t even afford 1 session as going through sessions would require several continuous visits. And so, the most I can do to help is to provide people like me a chance to at least have someone to talk to without the shame of getting judged or being anxious about fees especially in times like these as we are in the middle of a pandemic.
              </p>

              <h3> Description </h3>
              <p><b> TOMODACHI </b> originated from the Japanese word which means “friend(s).” The application itself basically relies on kindness and is free for anybody ages 15+ and above. The target here is individual(s) who have trouble expressing themselves and/or currently struggling with any mental health disorder(s)- the application gives them an opportunity to be heard and acknowledged. The best thing about it is it offers end-to-end encryption and complete animosity to avoid compromising the users’ private lives. One of the reasons I chose for this project to be completely anonymous is owing to the fact that I do not want to risk potentially discriminating any possible user. It is also an undeniable fact that most people find it easier to confide to a complete stranger rather than to someone they know personally. The application intends to show how many users are online in order to provide service transparency.
              </p>
              <p> There are two chat categories: <br>
                1.	Anonymous-to-Anonymous chat- this provides two anonymous users to talk and share their experience(s). Chats can be saved, potentially allowing both user(s) to converse with each other for some other time(s) if they are to establish a connection. It is both users right whether to reveal their identity or not with each other, we cannot intervene as it is a mutual consent just between two users. However, it is different for users that are ages 15 to 17 as they are still considered minors. It is the creator’s obligation to match them with the appropriate age bracket. Although, it is highly recommendable for those said ages to use the other chat option. <br>
                2.	Anonymous-to-Professional chat- a chat box for an anonymous user and a professional psychologist or therapist (the professional must be named for legal purposes; it might also be a gateway for said psychologist or therapist to acquire potential client(s) as I am not completely stripping off the idea that maybe the user can afford getting an actual paid session(s) with said professional as I do not want to limit the volunteers’ opportunity). Chats can also be saved allowing both parties to establish a professional relationship.
              </p>
              <p>
                Both chat box offers purchasable tokens that could likely serve as a tip which is available for both users (volunteers included). As it is a not-for-profit mobile application, anything generated in the service provided that could potentially acquire monetary value will be donated towards the developers (in hopes to improve the application further), volunteers and/or chosen charities that directly helps people struggling with mental disorder(s). And even if there are two chat boxes available, I am also adding a live general question and answer chat box where everybody can participate.
              </p>
              <p>
                A very important detail about the chat box is both users have the right to report each other respectively. Due to the chats not being monitored (if consent is given, chat box can be recorded) because of promised privacy the reports to be submitted will include a text box (can include screenshots) in which both sides can explain what occurred and to potentially solve conflict(s) and/or make the application better in the long run. I also took consideration of the fact that since
                the application’s main purpose is to help people struggling, to gain full access of the application both users must have their location services on while using the application as it is a practical and logical precautionary measure to avoid something as extreme as death. A button to call for the appropriate government authority is a must. Additionally, wrongful alerting of authorities will result to a hefty fine and/or complete ban within the application.

              <h3> Tools and Technologies </h3>
              <p> <b> TOMODACHI </b> will use the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) as it is one of the most widely adopted frameworks for instant messaging over the internet. For back-end language option, I would likely rely on Python, Go, or Javascript. As for front-end languages for chat, I have options such as React, React Native, or Flutter. I am considering building the application on top of a dedicated chat API and SDK solution as well as open-source collaboration via Github and other possible source(s) since it is a more practical way to focus on improving the application efficiently seeing that those options are highly critical to most of the messaging applications prevalent in today’s modern society.

              <h3> Outcome </h3>
              <p> By any stroke of luck that the project becomes successful in terms of having the capacity to launch it for the public to use, I genuinely hope for it to serve as a <b> TOMODACHI </b> for the people in need of one or more. The major problem of today’s world is severely impacted and/or linked to mental health issue(s), the problem itself cannot be solved by the application, however, I hope it paves the way for individuals to become better in overcoming the complications that comes with having mental health issues. Nonetheless, I am quite confident that if the application becomes a reality it will be beneficial for the potential user’s lifestyle and wellbeing.
