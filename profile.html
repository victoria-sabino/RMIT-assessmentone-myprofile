              <h3> Myers-Briggs Test </h3>
              <p> From Myers-Briggs Test, I learned that I’m a Mediator (INFP-T) and that I strive for constant improvement. The test also shows that I’m greatly associated with empathy, generosity, and open-mindedness which I genuinely perceive to be good traits for an individual. The way I see it, those traits are undeniably great when working in teams seeing that I can give a good amount of support that my team could potentially need. However, it also indicates that I tend to be self-
                critical, unfocused, and may have the urge to self-isolate sometime to which I can agree to a certain extent as my energy drains quite quickly especially when I’m at a social setting where I must interact for most of the part. To avoid being misunderstood, at a team setting the most I can do is give notice as advance as I can when I feel like my battery is about to drop.

              <h3> Learning Style Test </h3>
              <p> Out of my Learning Style results, I have confirmed that I am a visual learner which means that I understand and remember most things through sight. Visual learners are found to be neat and clean which I think can be linked to my urge to try my best in organising everything that I think I should be putting in order. I think it’s an important contribution to the team when a member is organised as it can be used as a precautionary method to avoid unnecessary mishaps to occur since it’s helpful when sorting out prioritisation in certain task/s where it should be done step-by-step. Nonetheless, being a visual learner means that I can be easily distracted during study time (and even as I’m typing this, I literally stopped for a solid minute just to check on memes, so my results is basically true to life). At this point, it’s a great thing that I’m very mindful of other people’s time so if I were to work in teams, I can give them a peace of mind that I can do the task that was handed to me.

              <h3> Harrison Assessment Navigator </h3>
              <p>The last one is my choice of test which I have done a couple months ago when I made up my mind to go for a different career path and it is called Harrison Assessment Career Navigator. It consists of questions that can help an individual (like me) to find clarity when it comes to choosing a future career that would suit best to an individual by measuring a total of 175 factors that compares interests, work environment preferences, task preferences, and interpersonal preferences to a comprehensive range of career titles. After answering all the questions, each career title has an allotted suitability score that indicates your likely fit with the career type. If people go for the career title at least above 75%, there are 3 times more likely to enjoy and succeed in that certain field. However, if they go for the career title with a suitability score that’s lower than 75% especially below 60%, they are more like to not enjoy or even find themselves leaving that career as quick as they can. My results as shown in the photo, clearly exhibits my passion for the IT industry. I have put a blue heart on my Top 10 Career Titles for me to easily navigate the ones that stood out the most to me. The one that stands out to me the most is the Webmaster as it correlates with prioritising needs and making solutions that can easily help put plans into development. My results from Harrison’s career navigator can be smoothly aligned with the positive traits I got from Myers-Briggs test as it conveniently compliments each other. It is simply straightforward and can provide assurance to a group that as a team member with those traits, you are found to be reliable, mindful, and has a strong sense of commitment.
