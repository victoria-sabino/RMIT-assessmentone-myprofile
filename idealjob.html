          <p> This job is in accordance with what I want to focus my work on and who I want to work for. Riot Games has been a huge part of my life and it would be an honour to work for them and/or to experience working with them if I somehow manage to gain their confidence. As of this moment, I am heavily invested with videogames and cybersecurity, therefore, this job hits the spot. They are looking for a Senior Software Engineer, Mobile Anti-Cheat to counter malicious intent towards their multiplayer games and help preserve the games integrity.
          </p>
          <p>A role like this certainly has a big impact on the company and so naturally there are responsibilities that comes along with it such as: <br>
             -	Having the competency to develop software solutions to detect and prevent cheating, <br>
             -	Being a good and reliable communicator to help game teams understand their specific <br>
                security needs which in turn help sharpen their security layers, <br>
             -	Having the ability to promote secure coding standards and design that reduces any chances of in-game cheating, <br>
             -	Being fully prepared to keep up to date with new and/or possible cheating techniques that could arise, <br>
             -	And lastly, have the capability to aid in identifying and establishing the possible impact that cheating could incur.
          </p>
          <p> More importantly, in order to be a viable candidate for this role, the individual must have a minimum of 4+ years industry experience, has experience building a software using C/C++, Java, or Go, has deep technical knowledge of mobile platforms, and sound knowledge regarding building and deploying mobile apps or sdks. Note that it is quite desirable to have any experience with mobile building tools (Android SDK/NDK, Xcode, LLVM), is familiar with mobile application security models, being certainly familiar with mobile executable formats, reverse engineering, or binary exploitation, and container solutions such as Docker or Kubernetes.
          </p>
          <p> Unfortunately, it’s crystal clear to me that right now I’m barely even considered a possible candidate for this role as I do not have any skill, qualification, and/or experiences needed to be one that I can attest with. However, it won’t stop me from working towards it or even something related to it. I’m looking forward for the endless opportunities ahead of me and it doesn’t matter how long it takes as long as I continue to gain more knowledge regarding the industry I’m passionate for.
          </p>
          <p> Once I attain my bachelor’s degree in IT, I hope to be competent enough to start somewhere and eventually find my way towards the career path I want. Nevertheless, I still plan on adding a Graduate Certificate in Cybersecurity and other certificates related to IT afterwards as I do not want to put a due date on my ability to acquire knowledge in an industry that doesn’t stop evolving.

          <h3> Where did it all start? </h3>
          <p> I was always a kid who ask too many questions- my curiosity is quite endless per say. I grew up in between the poor and middle-class family from a third world country so I wasn’t really updated with what the world was offering that time. If I remember correctly, a cousin of mine had a computer but he would never share it with me when I visit. If he does, he takes it back after 5 minutes or less. After that, I just had this undying thirst to know how it works and endless wondering of how it would feel like to own one. A few years later thanks to my parents’ hard work, I had the privilege to own one and the more I used it the more I realise that there’s an endless possibility on how to make use of it. I eventually got interested with building and repairing. It didn’t take long for me to master cable management and just figuring out what’s wrong on the computer or if there’s something that needs replacing.
          </p>
          <p>Currently, I have a full-time job which pays alright but I never really considered it as something I want to keep doing as I age. I have recently decided that I want to pursue a career in IT because I can see myself not getting sick of it in the future and perhaps it might even put some of my intermediate computer knowledge to good use. I stumbled upon RMIT because I was looking for something convenient and flexible and I thought that I should give it a shot and so far, it hasn’t disappointed me. The closest negative feeling I could link to studying in general would just be a personal one- I am extremely overwhelmed. I haven’t studied in years, and it just makes me feel so anxious. Nonetheless, I am trying my very best to keep up and get a hang of it which so far isn’t so bad. Lastly, I’m looking forward into learning a lot about mostly the basic stuff that every IT student should know of before fully committing into it and helpful knowledge about cybersecurity to be exact. <br>
